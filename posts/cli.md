# What is Command Line Interface (CLI)?

>C:\>npm install mysoftware

CLI stands for:

- Command Line Interface
- Command Line Interpreter
- Command Line Input

### Command Line Input

CLI is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions.

In the 1960s, using only computer terminals, this was the only way to interact with computers.

In the 1970s an 1980s, command line input was commonly used by Unix systems and PC systems like MS-DOS and Apple DOS.

Today, with graphical user interfaces (GUI), most users never use command-line interfaces (CLI).

However, CLI is still used by software developers and system administrators to configure computers, install software, and access features that are not available in the graphical interface.

 **Examples**
 ##### Windows Example
 ```cli
 C:\>npm install mysoftware
 ```
 ##### Mac OS Example
 ```cli
>npm install mysoftware
 ```

 You can navigate your folders (directories) with command line commands:
 ##### Windows Example
 ```cli
 C:\Users\myuser>cd ..
C:\Users\>cd ..
C:\>
 ```
 >Use CLI commands with great attention!!!
Wrong use can easily delete files or destroy your computer system completely.
